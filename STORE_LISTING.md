## Short Description (132 characters max)

Clear Domo cookies with one click to fix 431 errors when switching between multiple Domo instances.

## Detailed Description

### Overview
Domo Cookie Clearer helps you resolve 431 "Request Header Fields Too Large" errors when working with multiple Domo customer instances. When switching between different Domo instances (e.g., `customer1.domo.com`, `customer2.domo.com`), cookie conflicts can cause 431 errors that prevent pages from loading properly.

### Key Features

**Automatic Error Detection**
- Automatically detects 431 HTTP errors on Domo domains
- Shows a notification when an error is detected
- Badge indicator on extension icon alerts you to issues

**One-Click Cookie Clearing**
- Clear cookies for the specific Domo instance you're currently using
- Only affects the domain in your current tab
- Other Domo instances remain unaffected

**Privacy-Focused**
- No data collection or external requests
- All operations happen locally in your browser
- Only accesses `*.domo.com` domains
- Open source code available for review

**Smart & Secure**
- Validates domains to ensure they match Domo patterns (`customer.domo.com`)
- Uses Manifest V3 (latest Chrome extension standard)
- Scoped permissions limited to Domo domains only

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Detection**: When you visit a Domo instance and encounter a 431 error, the extension detects it automatically
2. **Notification**: You'll receive a browser notification informing you of the error
3. **Quick Fix**: Click the extension icon and press "Clear Domo Cookies" to resolve the issue
4. **Confirmation**: You'll see how many cookies were cleared and receive a confirmation notification

### Use Cases

- Working with multiple Domo customer instances
- Switching between different Domo environments
- Resolving cookie-related 431 errors quickly
- Maintaining separate cookie states for different Domo instances

### Privacy & Permissions

**Why we need these permissions:**
- **Cookies**: To clear cookies for Domo domains
- **Active Tab**: To identify which Domo instance you're using
- **Web Request**: To detect 431 HTTP errors on Domo domains
- **Tabs**: To reload pages after clearing cookies
- **Notifications**: To notify you when 431 errors are detected
- **Host Permissions (`*://*.domo.com/*`)**: Limited to Domo domains only

**What we don't do:**
- ❌ Collect or store any user data
- ❌ Send data to external servers
- ❌ Track your browsing
- ❌ Access non-Domo websites
